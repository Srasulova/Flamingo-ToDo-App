# Flamingo-ToDo-App

This repository contains one of my first solo projects - a basic ToDo app built with HTML, CSS, and JS.
As I learned the basics of these languages, I wanted to practice my knowledge in building a real app.

## Supports:

Add new todo item.

List todo items dynamically.

Mark checked to a completed item.

Remove an item.

## Doesn't support:

Uncheck an item.

Edit/ change an item.

Move a checked item to the end of the list.

A todo list filter.

Weekly, monthly, yearly task items.

Date and time/ Reminders.

## To run:

Basically, open the index.html file on your browser.

## Feedbacks

Please, share with me any ideas on how I could improve the project.
